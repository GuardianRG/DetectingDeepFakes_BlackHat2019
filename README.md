## Detecting Deep Fakes Blackhat 2019

This is the associated repo for the talk [Detecting Deep Fakes with Mice](https://www.blackhat.com/us-19/briefings/schedule/index.html#detecting-deep-fakes-with-mice-14467)

### Overview

As machines have gotten better at producing synthetic audio / video that look presumably real there is an ever present need to increase our ability to discern between what is real versus synthetic. The goal of this repo is to present a simple tool to detect real versus fake speech via the use of [bispectral analysis](http://www.cs.albany.edu/~lsw/papers/cvprw19b.pdf)
